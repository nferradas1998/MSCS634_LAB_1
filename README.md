# MSCS634_LAB_1

**Purpose:**
Learn to apply visualization, preprocessing, and statistical analysis using Jupyter Notebooks to explore and clean datasets

**Key Insights:**
- For this particular dataset, it was quite complicated to find clear correlations between different fields, specially numeric fields. This dataset really did look totally random, with no outliers on any category. So, even cleaning the data had no clear changes in the dataset.
- For example, in terms of shopping behavior between genders, I was expecting to see clear differences in behavior, but in terms of purchasing numbers, they were almost identical (as show n by the graphs).

**Challenges:**
- The challenge here was to make a clear correlation analysis, since the data was not showing any strong or even mild correlations between parameters.
- One of the most time consuming parts for me, was the final correlation matrix and heatmap. The reason being that my dataset had non-numeric values, and it took me sometime to understand how to ommit them to be able to see this matrix.
